# Castle-Escape-with-LFA

I developed a game that features a protagonist trapped
within a castle, trying to find the optimal route to escape. The
castle presents various rooms with distinct entry
requirements.
In this project, I leveraged automata-related algorithms to
efficiently convert a DFA into a CFG, and subsequently into a
practical PDA.
